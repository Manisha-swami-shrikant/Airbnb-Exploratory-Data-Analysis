# Airbnb-Exploratory-Data-Analys


## Business Objective
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset. This involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and using various exploratory techniques to extract meaningful insights and patterns.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Data Understanding
- Loaded the dataset containing 48,895 rows and 16 columns.
- Identified data types, missing values, and unique values for each column.
- Visualized missing values to understand data completeness.

### 2. Understanding Variables
- Reviewed column descriptions and statistical summaries (`describe()` method).
- Identified key variables such as listing ID, host information, neighborhood details, pricing, and availability.

### 3. Data Cleaning and Wrangling
- Dropped columns with high missing values (`last_review` and `reviews_per_month`).
- Filled missing values in `name` and `host_name` with "Not Available".
- Removed rows with price values of 0, assuming these were data errors.
- Removed entries with availability of 0 days in a year (`availability_365`).

### 4. Insights and Manipulations
- After cleaning, the dataset was refined to focus on essential columns for further analysis.
- The minimum price after cleaning was $10, indicating the removal of erroneous price data.

## Conclusion
The dataset is now prepared for deeper analysis, having undergone thorough cleaning and preprocessing steps. Further analysis can now focus on exploring relationships between variables, pricing trends across neighborhoods, and other relevant insights.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
